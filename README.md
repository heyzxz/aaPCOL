## Intro
PCOL is a WebGL based 3D billiards web game. You can now play an early preview version [here](http://www.heyzxz.me/pcol), just in your browser (See [Compatibility](#campatibility) section below).

The preview version only provides Snooker mode, more game modes may be added in the future.

## Technical Specs
This game is developed in pure javascript. The graphics part is based on [Babylonjs](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js) Engine.

### File Size
â‰ˆ6M first load without browser cache.

### Compatibility
It's mainly targeting for supporting the latest versions of these browsers below:
* **Firefox** ( Tested on both win & mac )
* **Google Chrome** ( Tested on both win & mac )
* **Safari** ( Tested on mac )
* **Edge** ( Tested on win )

**IE11?** - sorry no...

**Other WebGL-supported browsers?** - not test yet...

*Please note that as it is based on WebGL, performance/compatibility also depends on the GPU performance of your device.*

### Recommended Browsers
* Browsers with **WebGL 2.0 support** are recommended. See [here](https://caniuse.com/#search=webgl2) for which.
* According to my personal tests on mac (mid 2015, i7, AMD Radeon R9 M370X 2048 MB), **Firefox(60.0.2 (64-bit))** is the winner.
### Mobile Browsers?
Currently no... Computations are too heavy for them.

## Known Issues
* **Rules of Snooker needs to be improved.** Including:
	* Require the fouling player to take a shot again.
	* Jump shots Fouls. Currently it is just allowed.
	* Free balls. Currently don't have.
	* State the desired color when shoting color balls. (I'm still thinking about how...)

* **Some physical parameters needs to be tweaked.**
