## About The Game

## Technical Specs
Developed in pure javascript. Graphics part is based on [Babylonjs](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js) Engine.

### Compatibility
I mainly targets for supporting these desktop browsers below:
* **Firefox** ( Tested on both win & mac )
* **Google Chrome** ( Tested on both win & mac )
* **Safari** ( Tested on mac )
* **Edge** ( Tested on win )

( All of the above are latest versions by June, 2018 )

For **IE11**, sorry no...
For other WebGL-supported browsers, not test yet...

#### Recommended Browsers
Browsers with **WebGL 2.0** support are recommended. See [here](https://caniuse.com/#search=webgl2) for which.
According to my personal tests on my Mac (mid 2015, i7, AMD Radeon R9 M370X 2048 MB), **Firefox(60.0.2 (64-bit))** is the winner.
#### Mobiles Browsers?
Currently no... Computations are too heavy for them.

*Please note that as it is based on WebGL, performance/compatibility is also depend on your GPU performance of your device.*
